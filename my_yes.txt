NAME
       yes - output a string repeatedly until killed

SYNOPSIS
       yes [STRING]...
       yes OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Repeatedly output a line with all specified STRING(s), or 'y'.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

 yes command outputs 'y' or whatever is specified as an argument, followed by a newline repeatedly until stopped by 
 the user or otherwise killed; when piped into a command, it will continue until the pipe breaks
 (i.e., the program completes its execution).

It can also be used to test how well a system handles high loads, as using yes results in 100% processor usage, 
for systems with a single processor (for a multiprocessor system, a process must be run for each processor). 
This, for example, can be useful for investigating whether a system's cooling system will be effective when the processor 
is running at 100%.
