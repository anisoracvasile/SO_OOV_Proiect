DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi‐
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.



     -m      month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal
             number, appending ‘f’ or ‘p’ displays the same month of the fol‐
             lowing or previous year respectively.

  

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied
             when a year but no month are specified on the command line.
